Here's a simple API project idea for a beginner that incorporates authentication:

Project: Book Library API

Description: Create a RESTful API that allows users to manage a book library. Users can create accounts, login, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.

Features:

1. User registration and login (authentication)
2. Create, read, update, and delete books
3. Users can only access their own books

Tech Stack:

1. Backend framework: Django 
2. Database:  PostgreSQL
3. Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Set up a new Django 
2. Install required dependencies (e.g., mongoose, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt)
3. Create a user model and implement registration and login functionality using JWT
4. Create a book model and implement CRUD operations
5. Implement authentication middleware to protect routes
6. Test the API using Postman or cURL

Example Endpoints:

1. POST /register: Create a new user account
2. POST /login: Login and receive a JWT token
3. GET /books: Get a list of books (authenticated users only)
4. POST /books: Create a new book (authenticated users only)
5. GET /books/:id: Get a specific book (authenticated users only)
6. PUT /books/:id: Update a book (authenticated users only)
7. DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book (authenticated users only)

This project is a great starting point for beginners, and it covers essential concepts like authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations. Good luck!
