00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,473
Take a picture.

186
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,524
Go get the phone

187
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:03,628
Hello
-Can I sit here too?

188
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,712
- Yes, please.
-Thank you.

189
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:13,827
Mr. Jia is a very arrogant man.

190
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,434
I can't finish this.
Let me give you some

191
00:14:17,464 --> 00:14:18,887
no. I eat ice cream here every day.

192
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:20,938
- Really?
- Yes, there is no need.

193
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,039
-I am the panda nanny, Su Xiaozhou.
- Panda nanny?

194
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,015
I'm here to adopt...
-I know. I know that.

195
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,067
I've watched the news.

196
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:36,176
Can I ask you?
A few personal questions?

197
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,276
no.

198
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,243
I'm just kidding. Ask.

199
00:14:45,288 --> 00:14:47,321
How rich are you?

200
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:51,404
Next question.

201
00:14:52,451 --> 00:14:54,482
How many friends did you have?

202
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,448
Next question.

203
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,501
How rich are you?

204
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,610
Other questions other than these two
Ask me anything else

205
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:07,678
President.

206
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:09,740
I've just improvised a masterpiece for you.

207
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,793
Try it
-She's beautiful. Thanks.

208
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,743
- Thank you, boss.
-Thank you.

209
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:14,790
Thanks.

210
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,131
Try it, there will be a lot.
- No, no, no.

211
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,786
There is still a lot. Don't let him go.
There will be more.

212
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:19,838
I don't want!
I can't finish this!

213
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:21,891
Relax, Mr. Jia!

214
00:15:22,936 --> 00:15:24,969
that it...

215
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,020
He is very hospitable.

216
00:15:27,966 --> 00:15:31,013
-This is too much for me.
Why don't we go somewhere else?

217
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,081
Want to see a panda?

218
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,133
-Can I?
- Of course.

219
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:39,109
Come on, let's go!

220
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:43,193
I'll enjoy this later.

222
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:16,767
You big baby?

223
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:18,819
Is his name "Big Baby"?

224
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,796
What a random name.

225
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,848
It's a random name.

226
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,910
My pet's name is "Big Baby".

227
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,962
You big baby.

228
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:30,014
He's so naughty.
He's hiding again.

229
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:32,076
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

230
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:35,043
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

231
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:40,051
You big baby.

232
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:46,166
What is this?

233
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,736
He surprised me.

234
00:16:55,805 --> 00:16:57,824
..his maneuver is

235
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,863
Hugging feet.

236
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,839
Can I hug him?

237
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,878
Yes.

238
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,021
-He likes you.
- How do you know?

239
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:23,079
Because he will fart.

240
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,119
how...?

241
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:28,076
How did you know he was going to fart?

242
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:30,115
He just relaxes once in a while
He sees someone he likes

243
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,154
When he calms down, he farts.

244
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:38,140
It is truly exceptional!

245
00:18:08,473 --> 00:18:09,482
Good.

246
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:12,531
Our men are on the island now.

247
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,570

We are elite mercenaries.

258
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,218
Why would we kidnap a panda or something?

259
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:28,248
For your sake.

260
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:31,205
We're going to be a laughing stock in this business, right?

261
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:33,244
You will be a joke.

262
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,293
But this joke...

263
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:40,361
Its value is 100 million dollars!

264
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:02,487

265
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,555

270
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,808
I feel like I have no appetite at all.

271
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,847
I don't want to eat anything.

272
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:23,877
This is really strange.

273

But at least the situation is calm today.

274
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,763

No

292

I will get to know her soon.

Single, I'm single.

00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,276
- Move!
- They went down!

369
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,312
Move!

370
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,347
Back off!

371
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:14,408
They went down!

372
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,388
Can this star?
Cinematic combat really?

373
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:19,433
Yes. He's brilliant.

374
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,382
His kung fu fighting is really cool.

375
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:22,417
truly?

376
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:24,478
We'll see about that.

377
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,529
We'll see about that!

378
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,590
how's it going?

379
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,046
- Did you call the police?
-There is no signal.

380
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,589
No signal?

381
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,649
Carry it first.
Let me check what's going on.

382
00:27:46,851 --> 00:27:48,881
Jackie...

383
00:27:48,912 --> 00:27:50,942
Is this really you?

384
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,993
Yes. I'm Jackie Chan.

385
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:57,986
Good.

386
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:00,047
Where is the baby panda?

387
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,098
Panda?

388
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,595
- In this direction.
-Bring him

389
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,188
Be careful. He's very weak.

390
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:12,249
Yes, leader.

391
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:16,228
Why do you need a baby panda?

392
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,304
-Who are you guys?
- Can you really fight like in the movies?

393
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:32,521
I'm just a kung fu star.

394
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,556
Let's go!

395
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,617
Come on now!

396
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:37,667
- Come on!
- That's nice!

397
00:28:37,698 --> 00:28:39,728
Don't mess around, Jackie.

398
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:41,576
Stop!

399
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:42,611
Stop!

400
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:44,672
Loading...

401
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,737
Begin intensive cleansing.

402
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,984
You are brilliant.

403
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,200
Your hand is on me! I can't fight.

404
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,250
I'm just a movie producer.

405
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:25,296
I just...

406
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,347
Friend, okay? Leave me.

407
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,408
Good.

408
00:29:30,342 --> 00:29:32,372
Sorry.

409
00:29:32,392 --> 00:29:34,422
- Just an accident
.. -You

410
00:29:34,452 --> 00:29:36,482
You have no arts ethics
Self defense.

411
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:41,477
-Can you speak Chinese?
I know all these tricks, Jackie.

412
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:43,538
I've watched all your movies.

413
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,799
Can't escape? I got you now.

414
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:33,319
Wait...wait.

415
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,308
Why do you want to fight?

416
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:39,358
We have to do this, Jackie.

417
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,450
Good.

418
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,500
.in this case

419
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:57,600
I am waiting.

420
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:59,660
I think it's better here

421
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:03,741
here.

422
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:05,802
Do you see?

423
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,853
The ring. The ring.

424
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:10,816
Come here!

425
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:11,862
Good.

426
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:13,912
Let's go!

427
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:39,219
This isn't in the movies, Jackie. Get up!

428
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:00,556
Where are you going?

429
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:02,607
Stop, stop.

430
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:03,653
Good?

431
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:05,703
You won! I give up!

432
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:07,663
give up! Don't come close!

433
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,713
Don't come close!

434
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,763
Do you want this?

435
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,839
Take this!

436
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,875
I'll whip your ass! Take this!

437
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,951
I will flog you!

438
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:19,986
Take this...!

439
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,022
I will flog you!

440
00:32:21,052 --> 00:32:23,082
I'll whip your ass!

441
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:25,132
Take this! You deserve this!

442
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:26,178
Take more!

443
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:28,229
I'll whip your ass!

444
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:36,065
You lied!

445
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:38,126
You said you can't fight!

446
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:42,207
You also have no morals
Martial arts

447
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:47,214
I will kill you!

448
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:41,161
This is me. Enter here.

449
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:42,202
Come in.

450
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:43,659
The door is there. Come in.

451
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,718
Come in

452
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,725
Bump your head!

453
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,842
Bump your head!

454
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,269
Have you seen a panda?

455
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,339
.no. I didn't see him

456
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,418
What's going on inside?

457
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:43,468
I don't know.

458
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:45,526
Suddenly a gang enters to kidnap the panda.

459
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:48,504
Call the police!
-There is no signal!

460
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,612
No signal.

461
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,569
It's not your fault.

462
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,638
I'm with you.

463
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:58,697
I will protect you.

464
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,815
(Harry)?

465
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,885
Did you see anyone?

466
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:07,943
No
Don't let him get away, okay?

467
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:08,993
Yes.

468
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:11,053
(Harry).

469
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,218
nothing.

470
00:35:29,249 --> 00:35:31,288
no.

471
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,580
.it's all over

472
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,979
Welcome.

473
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,936
to stop!

474
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:07,976
to stop!

475
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:10,046
to stop!

476
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,124
to stop!

477
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:15,193
- Stop!
- Stop!

478
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:17,151
You!

479
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:18,190
You idiot!

480
00:36:18,222 --> 00:36:20,260
- Stop there!
- Stop there!

481
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:19,405
I'm not good at hitting people.

482
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,475
But I'm good at taking hits!

483
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:36,685
the curse.

484
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:44,861
Don't move.

485
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,949
How can I move?

486
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:50,926
Don't get up.

487
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:56,053
Is this a good place for you, Jackie?

488
00:37:56,074 --> 00:37:58,112
Let's go.

489
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:00,172
Good.

490
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:24,566
Why is he so hard to fight? the curse!

491
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:26,625
Let's go.

492
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:27,676
Close the door!

493
00:38:27,696 --> 00:38:28,715
Shut it!

494
00:38:28,735 --> 00:38:30,774
Hurry, hurry!

495
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,839
What should we do?

496
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:38,879
Are you asking me?

497
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:40,336
If not you, then who?

498
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:41,478
You?

499
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:44,964
I can't help it.

500
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:47,034
I am not familiar with this place.

501
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,151
“Tony.”
- (Jackie Chan).

502
00:38:52,182 --> 00:38:54,220
I am your biggest fan!

503
00:38:55,158 --> 00:38:57,198
- Who is this?
- It's the Noah Island robot.

504
00:38:58,237 --> 00:39:00,275
My name is Tony.

505
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,520
I'm on my way.

506
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,773
Hello handsome.

507
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,842
Can you let me pass?

508
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,819
Brother, can you let me pass?

509
00:39:40,053 --> 00:39:42,092
-There is no way!
Let me find him!

510
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,258
They are coming!

511
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:51,216
Let's go.

512
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:52,265
Come on, come on!

513
00:39:52,285 --> 00:39:54,325
Come on, don't be afraid.

514
00:39:54,345 --> 00:39:56,384
There is no road ahead.

515
00:39:57,332 --> 00:39:59,371
-There is no road in this direction.
- Get up here!

516
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,430
It's a tall building! No, no, no!

517
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,500
I can't do it!

518
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,558
Don't be afraid.

519
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:06,599
I...

520
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:08,668
I'm just a panda nanny!

521
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:11,644
Just imagine it's flat land.
Walk as if it were flat.

522
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:13,000
-It's flat! It's flat!
- Yes, yes!

523
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,346
Don't look down!

524
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:17,731
Where is this headed?

525
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:18,780
that it...

526
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:20,839
-It's like a dead end.
Come on

527
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:22,806
Let's go.

528
00:40:22,828 --> 00:40:24,866
- Come here.
Where are we going?

529
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:27,945
Let's jump from here.

530
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:30,014
What?

531
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:32,073
There is no turning back.

532
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,137
The cartoon panda will support you. Believe me.
-I don't believe you.

533
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:37,120
Boss, I'm just an ordinary nanny.

534
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,178
I'm not your risk taker.

535
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:41,248
Let's jump to the count of 3.
-I don't want to try!

536
00:40:41,268 --> 00:40:43,307
1!

537
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:57,507
Are you well?

538
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,586
car. Get on!

539
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,645
Where should we go?
.- Seat belt

540
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:03,695
Where should we go?

541
00:41:03,716 --> 00:41:05,754
Go. Go!

542
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,799
Where to now?
- Go!

543
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:15,592
They escape in a panda tourist car.
Look for them!

544
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,079
They entered the storage area.

545
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:30,139
It is out of the range of surveillance cameras.

546
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:39,344
James, they're headed
To the storage area.

547
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:45,379
It's very heavy.

548
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:57,631
Boss. You have a connection.

549
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:03,661
Oh leader

550
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:05,708
Jackie suddenly appeared and took the panda.

551
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:08,778
- Jackie?
- Movie star.

552
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,737
Tell James, you'd better...

553
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:15,810
To bring back the panda before I get there.

554
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,907
Let's go to the sidewalk.

555
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:51,326
I woke up.

556
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:53,281
I woke up. I woke up.

557
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,328
I woke up.

558
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:01,428
Don't be hasty.

559
00:43:25,797 --> 00:43:26,810
Hurry!

560
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,867
Come on guys!

561
00:43:36,893 --> 00:43:38,919
What?

562
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:41,979
Borrow your weapon.

563
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,407
Let's go! Jump!

564
00:44:12,427 --> 00:44:14,455
I'm coming!

565
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:23,502
Leave me!

566
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,550
Leave me!

567
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:27,596
Leave me!

568
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:31,578
Everyone, get out.
Find a safe place to hide.

569
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:34,638
Let everyone follow me.

570
00:44:34,669 --> 00:44:36,696
From this direction.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

571
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:41,783
I will fix the means of communication
And ask for help

572
00:44:41,803 --> 00:44:43,829
What about you, David?

573
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,885
I'll look for Jackie.

574
00:44:45,906 --> 00:44:47,933
good.

575
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,929
Your car's engines are running very slowly. Why?

576
00:44:52,949 --> 00:44:54,975
All our equipment here is slow.

577
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:57,021
Maybe for safety.

578
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:09,110
- He's gone.
- Look for him!

579
00:45:10,144 --> 00:45:12,170
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

580
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:15,139
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

581
00:45:17,186 --> 00:45:19,213
You big baby!

582
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,259
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

583
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,329
You big kid

584
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:26,376
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

585
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:28,332
You big baby?

586
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:30,379
-You big baby!
-You big baby!

587
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:34,452
(Su Xiaozhou).

588
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:36,509
- (Su Xiaozhou).
-Did you find him?

589
00:45:41,494 --> 00:45:42,507
Look at him.

590
00:45:42,537 --> 00:45:44,564
He sleeps like a baby.

591
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:47,624
He must have eaten too much

592
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:49,672
He ate all of it.

593
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:51,728
Does it taste good?

594
00:45:52,661 --> 00:45:54,687
no.

595
00:45:57,757 --> 00:45:59,784
Check your phone signal now.

596
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:01,830
Yes.

597
00:46:04,987 --> 00:46:06,880
I think they took control of the central control room.

598
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:09,354
Wow.

599
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,283
This place is not safe then.

600
00:46:13,105 --> 00:46:14,707
Don't bring us bad luck.

601
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:15,500
locomotive.

602
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:16,203
Take cover.

603
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,234
Is there another way out?

604
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:40,675
Yes, there's a side door from there.

605
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:41,983
Good.

606
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:43,331
Go when I tell you to go.

607
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:44,202
Good.
- Ready?

608
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:49,029
here.

609
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,103
Don't shoot any of you, you bastards.

610
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:55,590
We want them alive.

611
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,612
Good

612
00:46:56,637 --> 00:46:57,658
The door does not open.

613
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,367
Can't you open it?

614
00:46:58,393 --> 00:46:59,184
What's wrong with your mouth?

615
00:46:59,210 --> 00:46:59,962
Don't worry.

616
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,219
Come on, come on.

617
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:07,246
Screw it.

618
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:09,488
Come on, come on.

619
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:16,302
Come on, come on.

620
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:17,099
Climb.

621
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:18,225
locomotive.

622
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,211
Get on my back.

623
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,006
Can I do it?

624
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:20,659
Yes, do it.

625
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:21,409
Good.

626
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:28,180
The stairs.

627
00:47:28,206 --> 00:47:29,147
No, it's the elevator.

628
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:29,743
Good.

629
00:48:08,476 --> 00:48:09,684
He's coming down.

630
00:48:10,856 --> 00:48:16,416
"Translated by: Dr. Ali Talal! Fouad Al-Khafaji"

631
00:48:27,066 --> 00:48:28,233
Oh my God.

632
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:29,990
It's like in his movies.

633
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:32,486
I have to take some pictures.

634
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,850
You idiots, do you want an autograph or something?

635
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,506
Leader.

636
00:49:10,985 --> 00:49:12,194
What should we do?

637
00:49:27,582 --> 00:49:28,554
Leader.

638
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:29,849
Jackie goes up again.

639
00:49:30,418 --> 00:49:32,836
Who the hell chose the elevator?

640
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,004
Don't move, Xiaozhou.

641
00:49:38,037 --> 00:49:39,390
Watch the panda.

642
00:49:39,415 --> 00:49:41,735
Don't say anything.

643
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,592
I'm afraid of heights.

644
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:57,609
Panda, panda.

645
00:50:00,322 --> 00:50:01,505
Quickly, quickly.

646
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:04,258
Jump now.

647
00:50:05,296 --> 00:50:05,984
Smart.

648
00:50:06,017 --> 00:50:06,752
I am amazing.

649
00:50:07,448 --> 00:50:09,299
Where will you throw me?

650
00:50:10,585 --> 00:50:11,646
Jump.

651
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:13,261
Big baby.

652
00:50:13,287 --> 00:50:14,179
Know.

653
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,490
Are you well?

654
00:50:34,864 --> 00:50:35,979
(Xiaozhou).

655
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:37,335
(Xiaozhou).

656
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:42,632
Didn't you run away?

657
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:44,725
How can I escape if you can't?

658
00:50:44,963 --> 00:50:46,240
What a waste of our time.

659
00:50:46,308 --> 00:50:47,287
(Jackie).

660
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:49,011
Give me the panda.

661
00:50:54,238 --> 00:50:56,277
I'll give you the panda and you can set it free.

662
00:50:59,604 --> 00:51:00,516
Good.

663
00:51:01,443 --> 00:51:03,240
He didn't say anything.

664
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:05,421
No no.

665
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:06,756
Stay where you are.

666
00:51:06,832 --> 00:51:07,474
(Roy).

667
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:08,541
Bring the panda.

668
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,386
I?

669
00:51:12,766 --> 00:51:14,130
Don't be afraid, big baby.

670
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,249
beware.

671
00:51:16,535 --> 00:51:18,176
You're just like in your movies.

672
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,943
It's beautiful.

673
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:22,348
And soft.

674
00:51:22,607 --> 00:51:23,452
It's beautiful.

675
00:51:23,477 --> 00:51:24,359
It's beautiful.

676
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:25,254
pistol.

677
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,020
Don't move.

678
00:51:30,164 --> 00:51:31,820
I've never shot a real gun before.

679
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,253
Did you shoot?

680
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,205
Just to scare them.

681
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,588
The more I fear, the more they fear too.

682
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:36,437
Relax.

683
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:37,547
Well, I'm relaxed.

684
00:51:38,373 --> 00:51:39,711
Where is your gun?

685
00:51:46,246 --> 00:51:47,158
Big baby.

686
00:51:47,183 --> 00:51:48,565
Big baby.

687
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:51,310
Get out of my way.

688
00:51:51,336 --> 00:51:52,114
Big baby.

689
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:53,587
Boss, you sent the big kid...

690
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:54,492
Noah filling machine.

691
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:56,845
"Fresh packaged meat"

692
00:51:56,871 --> 00:51:57,851
Big baby.

693
00:52:00,877 --> 00:52:01,884
Big baby.

694
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:06,611
Big baby.

695
00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:12,724
Not you again.

696
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,072
no.

697
00:52:23,755 --> 00:52:25,808
You move very slowly.

698
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,664
Come and help me, boss.

699
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,317
I am trapped.

700
00:52:40,342 --> 00:52:41,822
Save me, boss.

701
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:43,072
Don't move.

702
00:52:43,124 --> 00:52:44,899
I'm tied up.

703
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:48,546
I can't breathe, man...

704
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:51,734
Stay glued to that.

705
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:54,953
Everyone ordered to lower their weapons.

706
00:52:55,198 --> 00:52:56,852
Everyone lower their weapons.

707
00:52:56,877 --> 00:52:58,500
He put a gun to my head.

708
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,114
Quickly or I'll blow your head off.

709
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:02,530
Listen to him.

710
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:04,546
His gun shakes in his hand.

711
00:53:05,823 --> 00:53:06,783
(Xiaozhou).

712
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:08,957
Throw their weapons away.

713
00:53:10,464 --> 00:53:11,491
"Tony."

714
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:14,226
Hello, Chuchu.

715
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:15,292
Lend me a helping hand.

716
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,339
It's up to me if it's important.

717
00:53:20,436 --> 00:53:21,544
I'll shoot.

718
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:22,381
Hurry up!

719
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:23,249
In the box.

720
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,527
Say it.

721
00:53:24,857 --> 00:53:25,978
Hurry up!

722
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:27,368
Put them in the box.

723
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,622
I don't like working late.

724
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:32,768
Go as far as you can.

725
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,565
(Xiaozhou).
Go with Tony.

726
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:36,482
The three of us will leave.

727
00:53:36,774 --> 00:53:38,915
Boss, take care of yourself.

728
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,070
I'm going, boss.

729
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:43,071
I can't do it, boss.

730
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:12,002
Get her out of the way.

731
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:13,144
They released her.

732
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:13,922
Hurry up!

733
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:14,994
Let's go.

734
00:54:16,635 --> 00:54:18,210
I'm going, boss.

735
00:54:25,093 --> 00:54:26,094
Leader.

736
00:54:26,335 --> 00:54:27,383
He has no weapon.

737
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:28,667
No weapon?

738
00:54:38,459 --> 00:54:39,729
Don't move.

739
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:50,236
Get me out of here.

740
00:55:04,128 --> 00:55:05,488
What should I do?

741
00:55:12,207 --> 00:55:13,606
"Operator's Manual: Electric Forklift"

742
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:19,193
Raise your hands.

743
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:22,825
Don't mess with my station.

744
00:55:36,514 --> 00:55:37,487
President.

745
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:40,107
I'm coming to save you.

746
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,895
I will kill you.

747
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:55,442
President.

748
00:55:55,837 --> 00:55:56,871
Give me a moment.

749
00:55:57,012 --> 00:55:58,898
There are three words I don't know.

750
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,286
move"

751
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:18,677
Boss, I'm coming to save you.

752
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:31,610
I'm here to save you.

753
00:56:39,705 --> 00:56:40,959
Come on, boss.

754
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:42,131
You almost killed me.

755
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:43,043
Sorry.

756
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:43,800
Ride.

757
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:47,273
Ride.

758
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:48,246
Get on board immediately.

759
00:56:50,252 --> 00:56:52,984
That's a hundred million dollars, you idiots.

760
00:56:53,695 --> 00:56:54,891
Screw it.

761
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,668
Can you do it?

762
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:05,277
Hold on.

763
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:09,077
Oh my God.

764
00:57:09,123 --> 00:57:10,347
Where are we going?

765
00:57:14,676 --> 00:57:15,642
It's a wrong way.

766
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,754
Do you have a driving license or not?

767
00:57:25,403 --> 00:57:26,396
to stop.

768
00:57:29,805 --> 00:57:30,846
Get in the car.

769
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:41,951
Director.

770
00:57:42,048 --> 00:57:44,516
We started evacuating visitors from the island.

771
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:46,445
Let's locate them.

772
00:57:46,521 --> 00:57:48,489
How long will it take to restore our connections?

773
00:57:49,136 --> 00:57:52,496
They damaged the primary communications power unit.

774
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:55,809
It will take time for it to be ready
To work with all his energy again.

775
00:57:55,891 --> 00:57:56,966
So hurry up.

776
00:57:59,865 --> 00:58:00,681
Director

777
00:58:00,707 --> 00:58:01,480
Look.

778
00:58:08,879 --> 00:58:10,075
Let's check out the panda.

779
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:15,583
He's fine.

780
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,694
They are following us.

781
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,320
They turned around.

782
00:58:27,345 --> 00:58:28,490
They turned around.

783
00:58:28,515 --> 00:58:29,354
They are coming.

784
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,791
They are right behind us.

785
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:31,462
Come on, come on.

786
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:32,753
Blue hair, boss.

787
00:58:32,778 --> 00:58:34,512
He's trying to catch me.

788
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:38,645
Hold me tight.

789
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:41,225
President.

790
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,573
Hold on to the pandas.

791
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,550
Are you okay, boss?

792
00:58:56,576 --> 00:58:57,550
President.

793
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,035
President.

794
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:03,966
Help me, boss.

795
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:05,327
President.

796
00:59:05,968 --> 00:59:07,077
He's coming.

797
00:59:07,112 --> 00:59:07,951
President.

798
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:10,410
You'll be fine, big baby.

799
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:11,643
Don't be afraid.

800
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:19,325
Help me, boss.

801
00:59:32,974 --> 00:59:34,353
Are you okay, boss?

802
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:35,291
Leave driving.

803
00:59:35,316 --> 00:59:36,236
Leave driving.

804
00:59:41,587 --> 00:59:42,702
No problem now.

805
00:59:42,727 --> 00:59:43,756
relax.

806
00:59:44,342 --> 00:59:45,945
Keep cameras trained on cars.

807
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,849
faster.

808
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,124
They turned around.

809
01:00:00,324 --> 01:00:01,284
no.

810
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:02,622
What is this?

811
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:05,830
Oh my God.

812
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,692
Put me down.

813
01:00:17,446 --> 01:00:18,501
Screw it.

814
01:00:19,361 --> 01:00:20,254
faster.

815
01:00:20,498 --> 01:00:22,405
Give me the panda, boss.

816
01:00:25,726 --> 01:00:27,037
Catch them.

817
01:00:27,063 --> 01:00:28,228
They're coming for us, Boss.

818
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:28,879
I know that.

819
01:00:28,904 --> 01:00:30,638
Our path ends.

820
01:00:33,742 --> 01:00:34,802
Open the gate.

821
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:40,863
The gate opens.

822
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,107
Quickly, quickly.

823
01:00:42,132 --> 01:00:43,423
Don't let them escape.

824
01:00:43,449 --> 01:00:44,504
Learn, leader.

825
01:00:45,759 --> 01:00:46,754
Wait.

826
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:49,081
Hold the button.

827
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:50,562
Close the gate.

828
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:51,635
immediately.

829
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,360
Why is the gate closed?

830
01:00:55,474 --> 01:00:56,341
Wait patiently.

831
01:00:58,173 --> 01:00:59,289
Let's go.

832
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:02,066
Let's stay close.

833
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:11,345
Okay.

834
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:14,315
They did it.

835
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:19,375
Stop screaming.

836
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:20,437
Stop screaming.

837
01:01:20,707 --> 01:01:21,734
The gate is closed.

838
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:27,017
"I entered the wild beast's territory."

839
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:29,671
This should be the easiest task.

840
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:32,669
Someone open this gate now.

841
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:36,724
Well done.

842
01:01:36,749 --> 01:01:37,514
Gate...

843
01:01:38,007 --> 01:01:39,386
There is someone to help us.

844
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:40,886
the boss.

845
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:42,132
He must be the manager.

846
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,727
The manager is in the central control room.

847
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:45,249
there.

848
01:01:57,317 --> 01:01:59,310
We are safe now.

849
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:07,883
"Wild beast area, do not get out of the car."

850
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,263
President.

851
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:17,289
We're safe now, right?

852
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:18,613
What do I know about that?

853
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:20,724
In fact, the situation is more dangerous now.

854
01:02:23,726 --> 01:02:24,646
We ran out of fuel.

855
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:25,694
No fuel?

856
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:27,786
How are we running out of fuel at this time?

857
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:28,706
Is it my fault?

858
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:30,732
Screw it.

859
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:32,120
What's up?

860
01:02:32,234 --> 01:02:33,276
lion.

861
01:02:35,939 --> 01:02:36,704
Screw it.

862
01:02:38,123 --> 01:02:39,008
What's up now?

863
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:39,683
He's hungry.

864
01:02:39,709 --> 01:02:41,448
He is hungry like a lion is hungry.

865
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:43,041
Get him something to eat.

866
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:44,889
Don't let him whine again.

867
01:02:44,914 --> 01:02:46,871
He only drinks milk at this time.

868
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:49,373
milk?

869
01:03:03,161 --> 01:03:04,174
Is this milk?

870
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,098
President.

871
01:03:06,348 --> 01:03:08,525
Is rhino milk beneficial?

872
01:03:09,426 --> 01:03:11,737
I think so, they share with the cow
The same name in Chinese is "Nu".

873
01:03:13,183 --> 01:03:14,530
What do you think of the snail called "Wanu"?

874
01:03:15,149 --> 01:03:16,117
Close your mouth.

875
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:19,664
Who will go?

876
01:04:17,898 --> 01:04:19,033
Don't scream.

877
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:20,700
Not me.

878
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:21,599
no.

879
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:43,388
President.

880
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:44,349
President.

881
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:46,378
Run without me.

882
01:04:47,353 --> 01:04:49,784
Did you say you're a failed athlete?

883
01:04:52,242 --> 01:04:54,108
Are you turning your back on me?

884
01:05:24,142 --> 01:05:25,840
They took over the sidewalk.

885
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:27,808
No ship will pass.

886
01:05:30,777 --> 01:05:34,799
Make sure we follow a schedule
To feed animals accurately.

887
01:05:35,341 --> 01:05:36,383
Director.

888
01:05:45,662 --> 01:05:46,676
Okay everyone.

889
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:48,452
You better get out of here now.

890
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,200
And find a safe place to hide.

891
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,565
What about you, director?

892
01:05:52,597 --> 01:05:53,403
I?

893
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:56,506
Do you know what I was before I became a manager?

894
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,256
I was deputy director.

895
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:32,043
there.

896
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,463
Don't move.

897
01:06:40,488 --> 01:06:41,668
Okay, okay.

898
01:06:42,227 --> 01:06:43,294
Good.

899
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:49,158
Welcome.

900
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:50,830
Director.

901
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,878
Please, open the gate.

902
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:04,895
It pleases me.

903
01:07:10,222 --> 01:07:11,175
Screw it.

904
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:14,915
Sorry, you'll have to find that out yourself.

905
01:07:27,588 --> 01:07:29,230
Is this all you have?

906
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:30,584
You coward.

907
01:07:36,903 --> 01:07:39,856
We have no choice but to burn the door.

908
01:07:41,076 --> 01:07:43,767
Search carefully. Don't let them run away.

909
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,251
- Your order, sir.
- Sure.

910
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:54,481
And now there are wild animals
Or mercenaries in these mountains.

911
01:07:54,506 --> 01:07:55,978
Be careful.

912
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,458
What should we do?

913
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,332
here.

914
01:08:24,043 --> 01:08:25,659
This lighthouse was abandoned long ago.

915
01:08:26,112 --> 01:08:27,632
No one from the outside knows about this.

916
01:08:30,184 --> 01:08:31,462
Electricity box.

917
01:08:32,812 --> 01:08:34,178
Watch out, boss.

918
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:37,073
What's up?

919
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:38,132
What are you doing?

920
01:08:38,266 --> 01:08:39,787
There was a spider there.

921
01:08:40,524 --> 01:08:41,523
Be calm.

922
01:08:44,484 --> 01:08:45,653
Slow down, boss.

923
01:08:58,885 --> 01:08:59,858
Hold it.

924
01:09:04,843 --> 01:09:06,439
Catch the panda.

925
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:12,496
I'm not sure if there's a risk.

926
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:14,559
I'll check first.

927
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,558
President.

928
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:28,090
The place is safe.

929
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:29,831
Go up.

930
01:09:33,883 --> 01:09:34,895
Leader.

931
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:36,809
Our men are still searching.

932
01:09:36,846 --> 01:09:38,749
But this place is very big.

933
01:09:39,358 --> 01:09:42,116
We have additional men to search the area.

934
01:09:44,104 --> 01:09:46,388
Search the whole area.

935
01:09:46,413 --> 01:09:47,811
You will search there.

936
01:09:47,836 --> 01:09:48,857
And you are with me.

937
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:49,481
Good.

938
01:10:11,919 --> 01:10:12,666
Is it over?

939
01:10:12,692 --> 01:10:13,407
Okay.

940
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:18,478
Thank you, President.

941
01:10:18,803 --> 01:10:19,876
What do you thank me for?

942
01:10:20,169 --> 01:10:21,942
I am his adopter.

943
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:23,489
It is my duty to protect him.

944
01:10:29,336 --> 01:10:32,515
Why did you bother with the panda?

945
01:10:33,737 --> 01:10:34,871
I love him.

946
01:10:34,896 --> 01:10:37,952
When I was in elementary school, I went
To the zoo on spring break.

947
01:10:38,394 --> 01:10:40,547
I was impressed when I saw the pandas.

948
01:10:42,307 --> 01:10:44,671
In college, I studied zoology.

949
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:48,901
When I'm on vacation I like to go
To the panda sanctuary as a volunteer.

950
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:52,080
I have worked and spent time with pandas.

951
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:54,246
For a full period of five years.

952
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:58,447
When I think about it, it's like a dream.

953
01:10:58,916 --> 01:11:01,268
Will you do this forever?

954
01:11:04,671 --> 01:11:06,234
"letter of resignation"

955
01:11:17,682 --> 01:11:18,768
Are you going to resign?

956
01:11:20,252 --> 01:11:21,923
My parents wanted me to quit.

957
01:11:23,765 --> 01:11:27,501
They are getting older and I hope to stay with them.

958
01:11:28,277 --> 01:11:32,652
Every time I tried to quit, he hugged my legs.

959
01:11:33,103 --> 01:11:34,883
I couldn't take a step.

960
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,830
What about you, President?

961
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:43,926
You've been fighting for decades
What keeps you going?

962
01:11:47,324 --> 01:11:48,751
What keeps me going?

963
01:11:50,173 --> 01:11:51,227
that it...

964
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:53,984
"Start shooting."

965
01:11:54,316 --> 01:11:55,437
"Start shooting"?

966
01:11:57,142 --> 01:11:59,112
I remember when I was eight years old

967
01:11:59,144 --> 01:12:01,960
I went to the set and heard
The director says, "Start shooting."

968
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,080
I was young then and did not know what it meant.

969
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:06,356
But wherever I hear the phrase
"Start shooting" somehow...

970
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,460
I'm filled with intense enthusiasm
And uninterrupted energy.

971
01:12:09,921 --> 01:12:11,225
And then...

972
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,001
“Start shooting” has become synonymous with me.

973
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,255
It is my trumpet and my starting pistol

974
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:20,620
Before you say “start shooting” I am like all of you

975
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,034
I'm afraid, in pain, and tired.

976
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:27,212
But as soon as I hear, "Start shooting,"

977
01:12:27,842 --> 01:12:29,296
Then I will become a champion.

978
01:12:30,134 --> 01:12:31,678
Perform any dangerous scene

979
01:12:32,141 --> 01:12:33,778
And he achieves everything.

980
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,203
In an instant, decades passed.

981
01:12:42,088 --> 01:12:43,433
Life is like a dream.

982
01:12:46,132 --> 01:12:48,027
But one always wakes up from the dream.

983
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:49,352
So when do we wake up?

984
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:57,066
Stop that and go back to sleep.

985
01:12:58,966 --> 01:13:00,106
President.

986
01:13:01,639 --> 01:13:06,102
Boss, don't forget to give the panda a name.

987
01:13:07,337 --> 01:13:08,398
Okay.

988
01:13:08,766 --> 01:13:10,417
What a great name?

989
01:13:11,229 --> 01:13:12,419
Help me.

990
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:14,170
And give me ideas too.

991
01:13:14,392 --> 01:13:17,422
It's easy to name a panda.

992
01:13:17,842 --> 01:13:19,141
For example...

993
01:13:19,284 --> 01:13:21,255
"pingping", "anan" = security.

994
01:13:21,304 --> 01:13:23,301
"Jagao", "Xinxing" = happiness.

995
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:24,707
"Mimi", "hoho" = astonished.

996
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:29,599
They seem to be asleep, as if dazed.

997
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,082
Let's call one "meme" and the other "hoho".

998
01:13:34,271 --> 01:13:35,685
Panda "Hoho".

999
01:13:36,023 --> 01:13:37,489
This is a great name.

1000
01:13:44,572 --> 01:13:45,556
Let's go.

1001
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:46,473
Move!

1002
01:13:46,562 --> 01:13:47,675
there.

1003
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,377
They are at the top.

1004
01:13:49,409 --> 01:13:50,483
It's noise.

1005
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:52,555
Catch them.

1006
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:53,416
There is someone here.

1007
01:13:53,441 --> 01:13:54,069
Let's go.

1008
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,178
Let's get moving.

1009
01:13:55,203 --> 01:13:56,983
There's someone here, boss.

1010
01:13:57,014 --> 01:13:57,938
I wake up.

1011
01:13:57,963 --> 01:13:58,875
Nobody arrived.

1012
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:00,341
What are we waiting for?

1013
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:01,326
Let's go.

1014
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:02,106
Come on, come on.

1015
01:14:09,114 --> 01:14:10,596
Don't let them run away.

1016
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:11,512
Catch them.

1017
01:14:19,551 --> 01:14:21,012
Boss, we have them.

1018
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:22,595
We got them, boss.

1019
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:24,149
We have to send them to the ship.

1020
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:28,610
Come back and I will talk to them.

1021
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,087
Leader

1022
01:14:55,834 --> 01:14:56,825
They are here.

1023
01:14:56,918 --> 01:14:58,439
How is my panda?

1024
01:14:58,834 --> 01:15:01,300
He was vomiting and not eating anything.

1025
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:18,364
You.

1026
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:21,910
Take care of my panda.

1027
01:15:22,004 --> 01:15:23,057
maybe...

1028
01:15:23,236 --> 01:15:24,757
I let you live.

1029
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,310
Let's go.

1030
01:15:28,336 --> 01:15:29,488
What should we do?

1031
01:15:34,215 --> 01:15:35,328
But Jackie...

1032
01:15:37,059 --> 01:15:39,037
So keep him here.

1033
01:15:39,412 --> 01:15:40,988
The ransom must be huge.

1034
01:15:41,013 --> 01:15:42,672
Well, let's go, baby.

1035
01:15:43,094 --> 01:15:43,894
Let's go.

1036
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:46,207
No no.

1037
01:15:46,232 --> 01:15:47,209
I will meet...

1038
01:15:47,236 --> 01:15:48,143
to stop.

1039
01:15:55,433 --> 01:15:56,105
As for you...

1040
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:02,028
Power in the sea.

1041
01:16:02,856 --> 01:16:03,760
Okay, boss.

1042
01:16:03,786 --> 01:16:04,541
no.

1043
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,070
Get moving!

1044
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:06,828
Let's go.

1045
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:08,512
No, please.

1046
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:13,498
no.

1047
01:16:21,051 --> 01:16:22,089
Let's go.

1048
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,154
Come in.

1049
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:46,333
Big baby.

1050
01:16:46,557 --> 01:16:47,569
Big baby.

1051
01:16:48,993 --> 01:16:50,365
Give me a minute, you big baby.

1052
01:16:50,453 --> 01:16:51,887
I'll get you out right away.

1053
01:17:02,822 --> 01:17:04,249
Come on, come on.

1054
01:17:19,027 --> 01:17:20,331
It's your last meal.

1055
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:21,577
Eat it.

1056
01:17:21,602 --> 01:17:23,159
Eat fast and go.

1057
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:27,577
Are you still alive?

1058
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:29,246
What do you think?

1059
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:30,100
Surprised you?

1060
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:30,990
You surprised me.

1061
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:32,893
These two.

1062
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:34,320
These are my two buddies now.

1063
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:35,340
(Harry).

1064
01:17:35,365 --> 01:17:36,085
(Roy).

1065
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,189
He is the great president.

1066
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,146
President.

1067
01:17:42,455 --> 01:17:44,045
What is this about?

1068
01:17:44,222 --> 01:17:47,666
No no.

1069
01:17:47,692 --> 01:17:48,845
I can give you both money.

1070
01:17:48,871 --> 01:17:49,987
I will give you more...

1071
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:53,142
no.

1072
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:55,550
no.

1073
01:17:56,597 --> 01:17:57,894
No no.

1074
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,956
please.

1075
01:17:58,982 --> 01:18:01,284
May I have a life jacket please?

1076
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:02,650
I give you money.

1077
01:18:02,684 --> 01:18:04,574
I give you money.

1078
01:18:06,465 --> 01:18:07,485
What are you doing?

1079
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:11,413
What are you doing?

1080
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:14,786
This is impossible.

1081
01:18:14,811 --> 01:18:16,235
Qayani in the sea.

1082
01:18:16,261 --> 01:18:17,568
We love.

1083
01:18:17,621 --> 01:18:18,615
There is no love.

1084
01:18:18,646 --> 01:18:19,918
No no.

1085
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,715
We love...

1086
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:22,914
(Jackie).

1087
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:23,763
Yes, yes.

1088
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:26,812
(Jackie).

1089
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:27,954
We love Jackie.

1090
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:30,652
Oh my God.

1091
01:18:39,344 --> 01:18:41,069
Are you my fans?

1092
01:18:41,613 --> 01:18:42,483
Okay.

1093
01:18:42,525 --> 01:18:43,762
It's show time.

1094
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:44,540
Show him.

1095
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:47,527
decent.

1096
01:18:47,552 --> 01:18:48,565
No, no, I believe you both.

1097
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:49,341
Sit down.

1098
01:18:49,366 --> 01:18:50,429
Okay, okay.

1099
01:18:51,072 --> 01:18:52,213
There you have it, President.

1100
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,565
They're stealing pandas for...
.Sell it to a businessman

1101
01:18:55,593 --> 01:18:58,037
But they don't know who the businessman is.

1102
01:18:58,218 --> 01:19:01,061
And now once you dock
This ship will be sold to the Panda.

1103
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:02,807
Wow.

1104
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:05,068
What about Xiaozhou?

1105
01:19:05,093 --> 01:19:06,924
Find the panda and Xiaozhou immediately.

1106
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:10,357
Can you confirm that communications
Are they all back on the island?

1107
01:19:19,957 --> 01:19:21,309
We will leave.

1108
01:19:21,768 --> 01:19:22,987
We will meet you tomorrow.

1109
01:19:26,701 --> 01:19:28,068
Watch out, young people.

1110
01:19:28,485 --> 01:19:29,448
Good.

1111
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:33,906
"High voltage danger"

1112
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:49,860
What are you doing?

1113
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:50,694
Stop.

1114
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,317
Move your hand.

1115
01:19:51,342 --> 01:19:52,171
Leave him alone.

1116
01:19:52,197 --> 01:19:53,290
Take it out of the box.

1117
01:19:53,317 --> 01:19:54,475
- Please stop.
- Stay away.

1118
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,313
Take it out of the box.

1119
01:19:55,339 --> 01:19:56,243
Let's go.
-Stop.

1120
01:19:56,843 --> 01:19:58,122
Don't touch it.

1121
01:19:58,486 --> 01:19:59,569
Stay here.

1122
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:16,743
Go and save Xiaozhou.

1123
01:20:16,768 --> 01:20:17,995
Good.

1124
01:20:25,163 --> 01:20:26,322
(Xiaozhou).

1125
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:28,855
I came to save you.

1126
01:20:28,886 --> 01:20:30,279
What are you doing?

1127
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:30,984
Stay away from me.

1128
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:33,490
This is me.

1129
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:03,971
Comrades...

1130
01:21:04,084 --> 01:21:05,425
It's game time.

1131
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,429
Listen.

1132
01:21:32,348 --> 01:21:34,705
I'll stay and go with the truck.

1133
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:36,221
You two get out of here immediately.

1134
01:21:36,246 --> 01:21:38,260
They called the police.

1135
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:39,567
I'll give you my watch.

1136
01:21:39,826 --> 01:21:40,642
Good.

1137
01:21:40,667 --> 01:21:41,713
Your watch?

1138
01:21:47,051 --> 01:21:48,446
I don't know how to use it.

1139
01:21:56,758 --> 01:21:57,802
The president is brilliant.

1140
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:03,273
Leader.

1141
01:22:03,449 --> 01:22:04,478
Leader.

1142
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:05,939
Leader.

1143
01:22:05,936 --> 01:22:06,948
Leader.

1144
01:22:10,481 --> 01:22:12,132
Roy, we trust this guy.

1145
01:22:13,181 --> 01:22:15,693
How's our $100 million?

1146
01:22:15,718 --> 01:22:17,387
Basically in the car, boss.

1147
01:22:17,413 --> 01:22:18,376
Keep going.

1148
01:22:45,609 --> 01:22:46,876
They saw me.

1149
01:22:48,181 --> 01:22:49,467
You mean these two people?

1150
01:22:49,493 --> 01:22:51,308
Don't worry, they are with us.

1151
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,417
They are with us now, as they have defected.

1152
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:59,085
What does he mean?

1153
01:23:00,069 --> 01:23:01,001
The bike, right?

1154
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:01,950
-Put your hand down.
Good.

1155
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,917
What do they mean?

1156
01:23:02,942 --> 01:23:06,401
They told us to take the bike and run away.

1157
01:23:08,124 --> 01:23:09,761
Don't be afraid, I'll count to three.

1158
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:10,581
One, two, three.

1159
01:23:10,607 --> 01:23:11,335
Let's go.

1160
01:23:16,489 --> 01:23:17,540
Who will drive it?

1161
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:20,274
Welcome.

1162
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:25,264
Welcome.

1163
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,107
Can you ride a bike?

1164
01:23:32,203 --> 01:23:33,031
(James).

1165
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:34,375
The police have arrived.

1166
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:38,467
Bring weapons.

1167
01:23:39,023 --> 01:23:40,844
Take your defensive positions.

1168
01:23:41,936 --> 01:23:42,885
They retreated.

1169
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,136
Secure that gate.

1170
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:41,514
The panda was captured.

1171
01:24:45,699 --> 01:24:46,668
Wait.

1172
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:52,503
This task was more difficult than we expected.

1173
01:24:53,141 --> 01:24:57,262
One hundred million dollars is not enough.

1174
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,668
We need more than that.

1175
01:24:59,816 --> 01:25:01,958
It's the price we agreed on.

1176
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:03,441
Don't move.

1177
01:25:06,376 --> 01:25:07,715
Why are you here?

1178
01:25:07,973 --> 01:25:09,192
Give me the panda.

1179
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,743
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1180
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:12,794
concept?

1181
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,344
Hey butler. The master will return soon.

1182
01:26:44,538 --> 01:26:45,628
What's the situation, President?

1183
01:26:45,654 --> 01:26:46,646
I'm busy.

1184
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:47,568
Speak up.

1185
01:26:47,594 --> 01:26:49,057
The police have located you.

1186
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,992
They are on their way now.

1187
01:26:50,017 --> 01:26:51,104
I found the huge baby.

1188
01:26:51,385 --> 01:26:52,387
Big baby.

1189
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:55,795
Is the big baby okay, boss?

1190
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:56,703
Arrested...

1191
01:26:56,728 --> 01:26:57,605
What happened to him?

1192
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:58,948
Big baby.

1193
01:26:59,124 --> 01:27:00,282
I mean, I got arrested.

1194
01:27:00,307 --> 01:27:01,984
It's okay as long as the big baby is okay.

1195
01:27:03,029 --> 01:27:04,389
Boss, the police will be arriving soon.

1196
01:27:04,413 --> 01:27:05,495
What did you say?

1197
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,858
Just don't give up.

1198
01:27:10,499 --> 01:27:11,920
I can't do it.

1199
01:27:11,945 --> 01:27:13,522
I can't stand it much longer.

1200
01:27:13,548 --> 01:27:14,513
What's the problem?

1201
01:27:15,131 --> 01:27:15,878
President.

1202
01:27:15,903 --> 01:27:17,079
I can't bear...

1203
01:27:17,575 --> 01:27:19,682
Boss, hold on a little longer.

1204
01:27:24,675 --> 01:27:25,833
President.

1205
01:27:25,859 --> 01:27:27,341
Talk to me, President.

1206
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:29,060
What's the problem?

1207
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:30,845
I am like all of you

1208
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,368
I'm afraid, in pain, and tired.

1209
01:27:35,242 --> 01:27:37,599
But as soon as I hear, "Start shooting,"

1210
01:27:37,972 --> 01:27:39,487
Then I will become a champion.

1211
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,936
Perform any dangerous scene

1212
01:27:42,292 --> 01:27:44,036
And he achieves everything.

1213
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:48,894
President.

1214
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,892
Listen to me.

1215
01:27:50,087 --> 01:27:51,062
"Start shooting."

1216
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:52,546
"Start shooting."

1217
01:27:53,528 --> 01:27:54,963
"Start shooting."

1218
01:28:56,735 --> 01:28:58,490
Don't move.
-We are the police.

1219
01:29:02,745 --> 01:29:04,275
How are you, President?

1220
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,482
Are you well?

1221
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:06,779
Welcome? President?

1222
01:29:06,812 --> 01:29:08,248
What's going on, President?

1223
01:29:08,272 --> 01:29:09,532
What happened to the big baby?

1224
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:11,173
Welcome? President?

1225
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:12,301
How annoying you are.

1226
01:29:12,326 --> 01:29:13,987
I know, how's the big baby doing, boss?

1227
01:29:14,012 --> 01:29:15,399
The big baby is fine.

1228
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:16,870
And I'm fine too.

1229
01:29:17,194 --> 01:29:18,190
decent.

1230
01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:19,345
See you at the pier.

1231
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:20,268
Okay, President...

1232
01:29:33,204 --> 01:29:34,605
Are you the one who wants a panda?

1233
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,408
Why?

1234
01:30:01,251 --> 01:30:02,591
Six months ago...

1235
01:30:03,883 --> 01:30:06,517
Pasha was diagnosed with leukemia.

1236
01:30:07,271 --> 01:30:10,019
That was when the little panda was born.

1237
01:30:11,053 --> 01:30:14,124
Pasha saw him for the first time on television.

1238
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:19,121
Since then we have been going to the park
animal almost every week.

1239
01:30:23,827 --> 01:30:26,660
Pasha leaned in front of the glass.

1240
01:30:27,408 --> 01:30:29,050
And I looked at the panda all day.

1241
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:37,638
Pasha's condition deteriorated rapidly.

1242
01:30:41,098 --> 01:30:45,382
I wanted the panda to stay with her for a while.

1243
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:48,618
Perhaps her health will improve.

1244
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,829
She doesn't even know what's going on.

1245
01:31:01,234 --> 01:31:02,542
It's my fault.

1246
01:31:03,344 --> 01:31:04,718
Oh God...

1247
01:31:06,744 --> 01:31:09,006
Please forgive me.

1248
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:16,883
Where is the panda?

1249
01:31:16,922 --> 01:31:17,993
Send to the dock.

1250
01:31:18,137 --> 01:31:19,146
Sidewalk?

1251
01:32:13,722 --> 01:32:14,779
Help yourself.

1252
01:32:54,794 --> 01:32:56,034
Am I dreaming?

1253
01:32:56,858 --> 01:32:58,130
You are not dreaming.

1254
01:33:01,587 --> 01:33:02,974
are you hungry?

1255
01:33:03,283 --> 01:33:04,408
Would you like to eat?

1256
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:09,499
He can't drink it.
I'll drink it, okay?

1257
01:33:13,741 --> 01:33:15,181
Are you well?

1258
01:33:15,303 --> 01:33:17,539
I was waiting to see you.

1259
01:33:18,012 --> 01:33:19,238
But I'm sick.

1260
01:33:24,469 --> 01:33:26,752
You know? He came to
see you for this reason.

1261
01:33:26,819 --> 01:33:30,577
You will be treated, your health will
improve and you will recover soon.

1262
01:33:34,036 --> 01:33:35,699
Can I play with him?

1263
01:33:36,135 --> 01:33:37,077
certainly.

1264
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:40,466
You can play with him as long as you want.

1265
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:10,307
Later: Panda Sanctuary in Chengdu, Sichuan.

1266
01:34:18,725 --> 01:34:20,769
Hello panda.

1267
01:34:26,568 --> 01:34:27,558
(David).

1268
01:34:29,556 --> 01:34:30,578
(David).

1269
01:34:32,953 --> 01:34:35,883
Clean the tank, then remove
the panda droppings.

1270
01:34:36,266 --> 01:34:37,741
I'm not hungry, boss.

1271
01:34:37,855 --> 01:34:39,350
I'll eat it when I'm done.

1272
01:34:44,982 --> 01:34:45,878
"Hoho."

1273
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:47,271
Come here.

1274
01:34:47,454 --> 01:34:49,218
Come here.

1275
01:34:50,342 --> 01:34:51,440
"Hoho."

1276
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:53,771
Come here.

1277
01:34:56,566 --> 01:35:00,580
“(Hoho) has a beautiful appearance and is full of vitality
He likes to stay in the roost to play and sleep.”

1278
01:35:02,352 --> 01:35:03,652
President.

1279
01:35:05,165 --> 01:35:06,498
We'll fly to Shanghai at 3 p.m.

1280
01:35:06,523 --> 01:35:08,508
For cinema events and holidays
Weekend in Milan

1281
01:35:08,533 --> 01:35:09,893
To promote your new film.

1282
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:10,633
By the way...

1283
01:35:10,658 --> 01:35:13,269
Corgis were owned by
the Queen during her lifetime.

1284
01:35:13,307 --> 01:35:14,372
But they were stolen.

1285
01:35:14,419 --> 01:35:18,778
The British government called to ask you
If you have any plan to save them.

1286
01:35:22,548 --> 01:35:23,316
Okay.

1287
01:35:23,681 --> 01:35:24,759
What's your decision?

1288
01:35:25,218 --> 01:35:26,781
Plan B for those who have no plan.
